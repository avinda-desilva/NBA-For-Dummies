# NBA For Dummies
## Stats Analysis of NBA Players

### Purpose:
The purpose of “NBA For Dummies” is to provide an interactive game simulation web application for the NBA based on player preferences of the user. In other words, this app allows the user to determine what team lineup is the “best” from their knowledge of the NBA. This allows for users to search for specific players they want from a specific season and have the ability to add them to their team which can be viewed as a table on the homepage. However, if some player stats are incorrect/missing for a player the user has the ability to update these stats manually. Moreover, the user also has the ability to delete certain players from their team if they choose to build a completely different lineup. Finally, once both of the users have built their lineups, the users can run the game simulator which will output the probabilities of that certain team winning over the other.
